											<h3>Project Overview</h3>
											Cardiorespiratory fitness is determined by the body's ability to consume, transport, and utilize oxygen during dynamic exercise. </br>
											One of the most popular and widely used methods to measure cardiorespiratory fitness is the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) test, which is typically measured during a graded exercise test.
										</div>
										<P></P>
										<div class="section">
											<h3>Dataset Description</h3>
										    Cardiorespiratory measurement from graded cycle ergometer exercise testing is a method used to assess an individual's aerobic (cardiorespiratory) fitness level  in our dataset.</br>
											There are 18 athletes in the database, representing 3 sports. The first 10 athletes are from fencing, the next 6 are from kayak and the last 2 are from triathlon.
                                            Of the athletes, 11 have a healthy BMI ,5 athletes are overweight and both triathletes are underweight.
                                            The age in our dataset is 12-18 The athletes' heart rates were calculated during the test, recovery, and rest periods. The time column was initially given in seconds, but it was converted to minutes.

										 <h3>Dataset Definition</h3>
											1. ID: A unique identifier for each participant in the study.</br>
											2. age: The age of the participant in years.</br>
											3. Weight: The weight of the participant in kilograms.</br>
											4. Height: The height of the participant in centimeters.</br>
											5. P_vt1: The power output at the first ventilatory threshold during a graded exercise test.</br>
											6. P_vt2: The power output at the second ventilatory threshold during a graded exercise test.</br>
											7. sport: The type of sport or activity the participant usually engages in.</br>
											8. MaxHR: The maximal heart rate calculated from the standard formula of 220 – age (in years).</br>
											9. HRmax: The maximum heart rate achieved by the participant during the graded exercise test.</br>
											10. VO2max_abs: The absolute value of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) measured during the graded exercise test in millilitres of oxygen per minute (mL/min).</br>
											11. powermax: The highest power output achieved by the participant during the graded exercise test.</br>
											12. HRrest: The resting heart rate of the participant prior to the graded exercise test.</br>
											13. time: The duration of the graded exercise test in minutes.</br>
											14. Vo2inmL/Kg/min: The steady-state oxygen uptake during the graded exercise test in millilitres of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute.</br>
											15. Vo2inmL/Kg/min/2: The steady-state oxygen uptake during the last 2 minutes of the graded exercise test in millilitres of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute.</br>
											16. ATHR: The anaerobic threshold heart rate, which is the heart rate at which the body transitions from primarily aerobic to primarily anaerobic metabolism during exercise.</br>

										<h3> Data Analysis</h3>
											<ul>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/crfVO2.png" alt="" data-position="25% 25%" /></a>
											●	Elite athletes in these sports can have VO2max scores in the range of 50-70 ml/kg/min or higher.</br>
                                            ●	VO2max% is a measure of aerobic fitness level as a percentage of maximum oxygen uptake capacity.</br>
                                            ●	Standard deviation of RR interval (SDRR) is a measure of heart rate variability (HRV).Higher HRV, as indicated by a lower standard deviation of RR intervals, suggests better cardiovascular health.Good scores for young athletes can range from 35-50 ml/kg/min.</br>
                                            ●	VO2max less than 35 may indicate low cardiovascular fitness and the inability to perform at a high level for extended periods of time.</br>
                                            ●	Participant IDs 1, 2, 7, 9, and 14 have low VO2max uptake.</br>
                                            ●	Participants IDs 17 and 18 have maximum VO2max uptake but are unable to perform for extended periods of time.So we extended our analysis further by calculating Cardiorespiratory Fitness Score
                                            ●	Cardiorespiratory Fitness Score was calculated considering relative VO2max, PVt2, Pvt1, relative power max, Hrr120, Hrr60, time rest, time, Athr, RR interval, RR, HRmean, VO2mean, and PWC170.</br>
                                            ●	Participant IDs 3, 11, 12, 13, and 14 have good scores.</br>
                                            ●	The remaining participants have low scores, which may be due to factors such as a lack of regular exercise, poor nutrition, inadequate recovery, and other health issues.</br>

										<div class="section">
											<h3>Conclusion</h3>
											<p>The comprehensive analysis of the athletes' cardiorespiratory data reveals significant differences across sports and individual participants.</br>
												 While triathlon athletes demonstrated the highest VO2max, their endurance capacities varied. A consistent relationship was observed between power output, weight, and heart rate in many participants. The data also revealed a positive correlation between power max and weight, and a linear relationship between power output and heart rate during exercise for some participants.<br>
												 Despite variations, a majority of the participants showed room for improvement in their overall cardiovascular fitness, emphasizing the need for personalized training and recovery plans..</p>
